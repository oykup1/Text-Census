# Text-Census

This program is inspired by the Unix command-line tool wc, which displays the calculated word count, line count, and character count of a given file. It handles potential errors, such as not being able to open or read the specified file, and provides appropriate error messages to the user. Program is invoked with the name of the file to count as a commandline parameter (e.g.: ./wordcount "./file.txt").
